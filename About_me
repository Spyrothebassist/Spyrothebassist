Hello! Thanks for checking out my Github! Below I briefly highlight what I'm about. Feel free to 

I created this as part of the Digital Skills Boot Camp in Data Analytics at UWA, Perth. 
I'm currently looking to make a career switch, having acquired a variety of digital skills the programme covered, including:
-VBA in Excel
-Python
-SQL
-R
-JavaScript (& JSON)
-D3
-Leaflet
-Tableau
-HTML (& CSS)

Here's my LinkedIn page for more professional details about my work and education history:

The people I've met, the interests I've picked up and discussions on topics and trends bigger than life constituted what I've found out about my goal in life:

I want to achieve a combination of information and entertainment in improving the world we live in.

This is the most comfortable way to convey a message. Information makes the intellectual link and increases awareness which combined with entertainment through emotional connection.

I have learned I already have the talent to combine this, and with my recently acquired skills in Data Analytics I hope to make change happen where it can be most effective!
